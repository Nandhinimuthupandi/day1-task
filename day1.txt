 1. Difference between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2    
 
 I. HTTP1.1:
    
        It works on a textual format.There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it 
        until it doesn’t get its all resources.
        
        It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.It compresses data by itself.

II. HTTP2:

        It works on the binary protocol.It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.

        It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.It uses HPACK for data compression.


 
  2. Objects and its internal representation in Javascript

      Objects are a collection of data that comes in a key value pair.   Compare it with a cup, for example. 
      A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc.
      The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.     
        
        The syntax of creating object is:

            object={property1: value1;property2:value2;...}

        Example :  

            var obj = {
                Name : Jeni;
                Age  : 27;
                DOB  : 02/02/1996;
                Mobile No. : 9123456789;
                Email: jeni02@gmail.com
            }

         The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:

            objectName.property

                    (OR)

            objectName[“property”]

        Objects can also have methods.Methods are action that can be performed on objects.Methods are stored in 
        properties as function defintions.

        The syntax for accessing object method :

           Objectname.Methodname()
